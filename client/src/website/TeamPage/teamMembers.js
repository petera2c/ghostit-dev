      "If we told you Rahul was Batman, you probably wouldn’t believe us. Regardless of what you think, that is what we call him, although we spell it ‘Bhatman’. In his 9+ years of launching and growing small to medium-sized businesses, he has developed a taste for seeing numbers rise and makes it a priority to ensure growth in all of our clients’ businesses.

      "Having come from a long line of successful writers, journalists and editors, it shouldn't have come as a surprise for Mishar to end up a writer — but it did. She loves helping people find their voice and create a solid brand. Her many years travelling and living abroad has given her a unique voice of her own to tell stories of any nature. When she's not creating content, you might find her in the kitchen trying something new. However, she's often on the go searching for the best coffee, the best craft beer, and the best food... All the food.",

      "Although most of her life is spent chasing after her preschool-aged daughter, Erika enjoys the time she gets to either be out living it up with great friends or at home with her nose buried in a book. When she gets a chance to sit at her computer, Erika loves researching and writing about just about everything. But it's fashion, beauty and lifestyle topics that are truly her expertise. You may actually see a novel out with her name on it someday! She sees herself as somewhat of a budding “domestic goddess” and believes all problems can be solved with a good cup of tea and large amounts of chocolate.",
