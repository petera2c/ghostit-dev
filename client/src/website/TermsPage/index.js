        <p className="my8">
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
          (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a

          you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p className="my8">
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Ghostit
          cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
          your online account management page or by contacting Ghostit customer
