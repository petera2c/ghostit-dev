                that best fits for your companyâ€™s needs. And like a perfectly
                synchronized tag team, the content coordinator tags in the
                writer to get writing.
                <br />
                <br />
                Before it goes live, all the content we create for you is edited
                by the coordinator first. Then, it's put up for your approval,
                or automatically scheduled and posted, depending on your
                preference.
