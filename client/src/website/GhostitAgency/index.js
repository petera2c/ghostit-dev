                ‍Before we can start creating your content, we need to know who
                you are. Understanding your company is our mission and allows us
                to create great content. We want to know you better than any
                digital agency can. That starts with a conversation and a
                questionnaire. What are your KPIs? What are your top goals? The
                more we know about you, the faster we will be able to increase
                your site traffic.

                Once your content strategy has been created and we are ready to
                start writing, our content coordinator finds an in-house writer
                that best fits for your company’s needs. And like a perfectly
                synchronized tag team, the content coordinator tags in the
                writer to get writing. Before it goes live, all the content we
                create for you is edited by the coordinator first. Then, it's
                put up for your approval, or automatically scheduled and posted,
                depending on your preference.
