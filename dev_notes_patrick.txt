Need to build functionality for creating a custom task in campaigns.

Bottom row of calendar is displaying the second half of the week a little out of line with the rest of the calendar.

(components/CampaignModal)
Change post-list-entry buttons to divs with the same onClick function as in the buttons.
  Then add an [x] div within them that has an onClick function that deletes the post from the db and campaign.

Saving post within campaign after adding an image to it results in an error.

(components/CampaignModal)
Should we sort the list entries chronologically or leave it up to the users to create their posts in the correct order?
We could also give the user the functionality to drag/drop the entries to re-order.

Need campaigns and their respective posts to be deleted in the DB whenever a user exits the campaign without publishing it.
User might not want to delete campaign when they leave the modal so we should prompt them to publish, delete, or revert to previous campaign attributes/posts if they were just editing an existing one?
Maybe have a system that saves them as drafts where the posts aren't considered 'active' until they are published properly.

A campaign in DB is being saved as:
{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "5b6bf8f966ac6113e895031f"
    },
    "startDate": {
        "$date": "2018-08-15T08:17:04.067Z"
    },
    "endDate": {
        "$date": "2018-08-18T06:59:04.067Z"
    },
    "name": "yay",
    "userID": {
        "$oid": "5b47bbef91b71202904eeef6"
    },
    "color": "var(--campaign-color1", <<-------------- should this be "var(--campaign-color1)"? (missing parenthesis?)
    "posts": [
    etc......
}

From Kimia's interface, should we add the extra instruction box to every (non-custom task) post as well? (I think so)
