(on my school laptop)
Bottom row of calendar is displaying the second half of the week a little out of line with the rest of the calendar.

(components/CampaignModal)
Later think about sorting posts in a campaign chronologically on the fly.
(when changing a post time, have its place in the list move if necessary).

Ability for the users to 'duplicate' a post in a campaign.

Maybe add feedback that lets the user know when their post / campaign has been successfully saved.

highlight the post list entry that belongs to the active post.

sometimes clicking an account to post to doesn't give feedback that the account was chosen until something else is changed.

prompt users when they try to delete a post.

notification window shouldn't close when clicking inside of it (prompt user to modify campaign dates or delete campaign).

add event listener to exit modals with escape key.

give posts a title.
show the title in the post list entries and on the calendar.

when user has no posts on their calendar to show, have a "Create your first campaign" button on today's date.

highlight the current day on the calendar.


to do next:
-prompt users when switching posts within a campaign if their current post hasn't been saved.
-prompt users when they try to delete a post.
-give posts a title.
  -add social type icon to the post list entry
