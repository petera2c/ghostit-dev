useful git commands:
  overwrite pat-branch to be the same as master
    git push origin +master:pat-branch
  delete local copy of pat-branch so that pulling the new copy doesn't try to merge
    git checkout master
    git branch -D pat-branch
    git checkout pat-branch
    git pull ghostit pat-branch
  merge the changes in pat-branch back into the master branch
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git merge pat-branch
    git push origin master
  merge changes in master into pat-branch without affecting master
    git checkout master
    git pull ghostit master
    git checkout pat-branch
    git merge master
    git push ghostit pat-branch
  delete pat-branch from github then make it a branch from master
    git push ghostit -f :pat-branch   // deletes pat-branch from github
    git checkout master
    git branch -D pat-branch          // deletes local pat-branch
    git branch pat-branch             // creates local pat-branch from master
    git push ghostit pat-branch

imagine scenario:
  var = 4; this.setState({ var: 4 });
    vs
  var = 4; if (this.state.var !== 4) this.setState({ var: 4 });
  is it more efficient / better to do the if beforehand if it will occasionally cancel out the setState call?

(components/CampaignModal)

Ability for the users to 'duplicate' a post in a campaign.

sometimes clicking an account to post to doesn't give feedback that the account was chosen until something else is changed.

prompt users when they try to delete a post.

when user has no posts on their calendar to show, have a "Create your first campaign" button on today's date.

whiteboard:
  - ability to create colour for custom task
    (should the user be able to use a full colour picker or should we just give more colours that are different from the campaign colours? what should the default colour be?)
  - recipe.author
    ()
  - calendar event completed checkmarks / custom task completed
    (show a checkmark beside posts on the calendar that have been posted. show them for custom tasks as well but the only way to toggle the checkmark is for the user to open the task and mark it completed themselves.)

recipe edit and delete
  campaign and recipe:
    recipe editing: posts need some way to display which social type it is (besides just the color of its list button)
    custom tasks need their own colour

make campaignModal footer its own component

campaign start and end date button "Wrap Posts" which sets the start and end dates to the earlier and latest posting date of all the posts.

maybe for recipeEditing, the Save Template button can change a little bit if somethingChanged = true?

sort recipes by use count?

search recipes.

"Schedule all with default account" button for when creating a campaign from a recipe.

infinite loading icon when no recipes in db.

discard changes to campaign button before exit saves them.

mobile app that alerts the user when they need to do a custom task?

Small question marks beside things that aren't super intuitive. Mousing over the question mark displays a tooltip explaining things.

multi-user calendars:
  in the content page, there could be a dropdown menu with all of the calendars associated with your account
    Filter Calendar styled button under October 2018 that shwows the name of the current calendar.
  each user account starts with a Personal calendar
    (should the default calendar be delete-able? should you be able to invite other people to it?)
  users can choose which calendar is their defualt one that opens up first always
  each post / campaign will now be associated with a calendarID instead of userID.
    posts will also have to store the userID of the person who created (and maybe a history of who made edits and what they were?)
  each calendar will have a list of userIDs that have access to it.
  should social accounts be tied to userID or calendarID or both?
    maybe the calendar admin can set certain accounts to be calendar shared?
  sockets keep all connected users updated to the calendar whenever there are changes to it.
  Manage Calendars page or just have all the calendar management stuff on the content page?
    create new, delete, invite people (emails), rename,
    attach / remove social accounts from the calendar,
    change permissions: who the admin is, who can add social accounts to the calendar (should they also be able to remove other people's?)

to do next:
  manage calendars
      create calendar button maybe should just be a (+) icon beside the calendar picker in calendar manager
      when exiting calendar manager, change activeCalendarIndex of ContentPage to the same as CalendarManager
  social accounts tied to calendars
    when updating social account access tokens, maybe update all that are linked to calendars?
    when looking up calendar.accountIDs, if one is not found, should we remove its id from calendar.accountIDs?
  maybe have other attributes for calendars (created by, date created, name history, post count (pending/posted))
  have a chat "room" built into the calendar manager.
    move the account cards below the user cards and have the chat below the name div.
    timestamps on each message (timezone?)
    chat should be able to be toggled to activity log which keeps a record of all post saves/deletes/updates/calendar rename/invite/user joins/kicks

  sockets:
    work on the prompt that appears when your active post gets updated+saved by someone else


    are images working?

  deleting a post in a campaign currently deletes the postID within the campaign DB object then deletes the
  post DB object.
    this could be bad if the postID is deleted from the campaign object but not the post from the DB bcz
    then the post won't be shown on the calendar but they will be posted?

  for campaigns and posts, keep a history array which stores objects detailing who made what changes between each save
    (mouse over the history to see a list of all the changes)
    (the list entries could show who, when, and which attributes were modified)
    (clicking on them could show a smaller popup display of the post's state after that modification?)

  date time picker calendar goes from monday->sunday instead of sunday->saturday

  socket manager for deleting posts from a campaign doesn't delete images. test with cloudinary to make sure that images arent deleted properly.

  make every email lower case in database

  give users a name attribute as well

  posts should display who their creator was

  Filter Calendar, Queue Preview, and Month/Year text should re-size based on window size

  campaign modal maybe have the name, start date, end date all appear in a "compact" version when their normal displays are hidden

  calendar/socket styles to fix:
    calendar picker (make sure all names fit properly into their containers and use ... on names that are too long)
    user list (make sure all names fit like calendar picker but also make sure the dropdown stays within the page)
    calendar manager user / account cards
    socket user list in campaign modal is outside the modal and gets cut off (longer names)
    not a huge fan of calendar picker not including the currently selected calendar


    BASIC calendars:
      when a user opens content page and fetches their calendars
        if there are calendars:
          for each calendar:
            if the user is the calendar admin:
              if user.role === "demo":
                if calendar.postsLeft === -1:
                  calendar.postsLeft = 0
                  (this way, if user goes from paid -> unpaid, their calendar becomes locked)
              else:
                if calendar.postsLeft !== -1:
                  calendar.postsLeft = -1
                  (this way, if user goes from unpaid -> paid, their calendar becomes unlocked)
        else no calendars:
          create a new calendar
          if user.role === "demo":
            calendar.postsLeft = 10
          else:
            calendar.postsLeft = -1

      when a user attempts to save a post (custom task, post)
        look up all posts in the DB with calendarID, status === "pending"
          (we don't check for the already posted posts since if the user deleted them after they went out, they wouldnt be detected)
          if calendar.postsLeft <== foundPosts.length: (no posts left to schedule)
            send back an error that they are out of posts to schedule
          else:
            let them schedule it

      when a post is sent out
        look up its calendar in the DB.
          if calendar.postsLeft > 1:
            calendar.postsLeft -= 1
              (this way, it'll never decrement from 0 to -1 accidentally causing a demo calendar to go to paid status)
              (we decrement this attribute bcz we don't count the already posted posts when checking if the calendar can still schedule more posts)
          else:
            do nothing


      bugs to fix:
        campaign list of posts doesn't scroll when lots of posts
        home page is making a request for  GET /api/calendar/accounts/1234 which console logs a message
        bottom of home page divs are given ugly backgrounds
        pricing page isnt ready
        campaign modal when the window size is small, the content half shrinks before the post list half shrinks
