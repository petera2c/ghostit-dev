useful git commands:
  overwrite pat-branch to be the same as master
    git push origin +master:pat-branch
  delete local copy of pat-branch so that pulling the new copy doesn't try to merge
    git checkout master
    git branch -D pat-branch
    git checkout pat-branch
    git pull ghostit pat-branch
  merge the changes in pat-branch back into the master branch
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git merge pat-branch
    git push origin master
  delete pat-branch from github then make it a branch from master
    git push ghostit -f :pat-branch
    git checkout master
    git branch -D pat-branch
    git branch pat-branch
    git push ghostit pat-branch

imagine scenario:
  var = 4; this.setState({ var: 4 });
    vs
  var = 4; if (this.state.var !== 4) this.setState({ var: 4 });
  is it more efficient / better to do the if beforehand if it will occasionally cancel out the setState call?

(components/CampaignModal)

Ability for the users to 'duplicate' a post in a campaign.

sometimes clicking an account to post to doesn't give feedback that the account was chosen until something else is changed.

prompt users when they try to delete a post.

when user has no posts on their calendar to show, have a "Create your first campaign" button on today's date.

whiteboard:
  - ability to create colour for custom task
    (should the user be able to use a full colour picker or should we just give more colours that are different from the campaign colours? what should the default colour be?)
  - recipe.author
    ()
  - calendar event completed checkmarks / custom task completed
    (show a checkmark beside posts on the calendar that have been posted. show them for custom tasks as well but the only way to toggle the checkmark is for the user to open the task and mark it completed themselves.)

recipe edit and delete
  campaign and recipe:
    recipe editing: posts need some way to display which social type it is (besides just the color of its list button)
    custom tasks need their own colour

make campaignModal footer its own component

campaign start and end date button "Wrap Posts" which sets the start and end dates to the earlier and latest posting date of all the posts.

maybe for recipeEditing, the Save Template button can change a little bit if somethingChanged = true?

sort recipes by use count?

search recipes.

"Schedule all with default account" button for when creating a campaign from a recipe.

infinite loading icon when no recipes in db.

discard changes to campaign button before exit saves them.

mobile app that alerts the user when they need to do a custom task?

Small question marks beside things that aren't super intuitive. Mousing over the question mark displays a tooltip explaining things.
