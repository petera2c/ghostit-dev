(components/CampaignModal)
Later think about sorting posts in a campaign chronologically on the fly.
(when changing a post time, have its place in the list move if necessary).

Ability for the users to 'duplicate' a post in a campaign.

Maybe add feedback that lets the user know when their post / campaign has been successfully saved.

sometimes clicking an account to post to doesn't give feedback that the account was chosen until something else is changed.

prompt users when they try to delete a post.

when user has no posts on their calendar to show, have a "Create your first campaign" button on today's date.

highlight the current day on the calendar.

exiting campaign modal while on an unsaved post should maybe prompt.

next tasks:
-feedback beside post entries whether they have been saved or not
